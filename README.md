# Pinardy's personal website

This website is my first ever project handling ReactJS. This serves as my springboard to learn about the ReactJS ecosystem.

This site was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a static site generator for ReactJS.

Install a starter site (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:

```
gatsby new gatsby-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
```

## Running in Development

`gatsby develop`

## Deploy to Github Pages

`npm run deploy`
