(2017.7)* -->\\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\\n<p>It’s not only an audio/visual art work but also an instrument that everyone can play with to become a DJ + VJ. Based on the idea of Patatap, “Beact” uses Two.js, Tone.js as audio and visual engine library respectively. It combines the concept of sequencer with keyboard, becoming a complete set for musician to perform their work in a browser. This project merges creative coding into the software architecture with conceptual integrity.</p>\\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\\n<p>In my spare time, I followed some artists/hackers/musicians who utilize the browser and internet as media to create. Sometimes, I found works so astonishing that I couldn’t close mouth in front of my computer. The concept “Patatap” is really fascinating, that each letter corresponds to a sound and an animation. It transforms abstract words into a beautiful outcome.</p>\\n<p>After a while, I wanted to use it as an instrument for my performance and compose songs out of it. However, the system didn’t allow me to do that. I started thinking about modifying it.

When I finished the front-end program which is the core logic of this project, I asked two of my friends, Yu-An Chan and Joey Huang, help me with the back-end and CSS respectively. I became the technical leader and project manager of the 3-person team, and was in charge of all the front-end design, including visual and audio effects.</p>\\n<p>We used git as the version controlling tool. The size of the source code made the cooperation significantly hard, and resulted some conflicts difficult to resolve.

Therefore, I had to find the ones the most suitable for my project.

After a time, I added the connection port to midi controller to let musicians play “Beact” with their own instruments. Thereafter, Beact is not merely a simple app for people to have fun with, but a powerful audio/visual tool that can be accessed with simply a browser for performers.</p>\\n<h2>Interactive Performance</h2>\\n<p>I was so ambitious that I want to add more interactivity to Beact. Two weeks before the debut of Beact, I redesigned the server to let audience send signal to the screen on stage during performances.</p>\\n<h2>UI/UX analysis</h2>\\n<p>When I finished first the stable version of Beact and published it using Heroku, I got some feedback that some users felt not intuitional enough to use it without text-based manual.
