title: Graduated from SUTD
date: "2018-8-17"

I just finished my last paper today, and this marks the end of the SUTD journey for me. While this is the end of my SUTD journey, it is a start of a new one. My future plan is to continue improving my software development skills and look to work in a company where I can do web development.

For now, it's time for a holiday to Australia!
