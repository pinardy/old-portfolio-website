2020 was a hectic year with the explosion of covid cases throughout the world and in Singapore as well. In DSTA, I was called upon to help out with developing a Command & Control (C2) application to aid the Singapore Army for efficient monitoring and response to manage the explosion of covid cases among the migrant workers in April 2020. 

It was certainly a very tiring period for myself and the team, where we worked many long nights and even on weekends and public holidays. However, we managed to develop and deploy the system within a hectic 2 weeks and gradually improved it along the way. I am glad that this project was awarded the Defence Technology Prize for Engineering in the Team category. This meant that all the effort put into the project was recognised not only by the company, but by the Singapore government.

I learnt how dirty data can get in the real world, and how our systems should be able to handle dirty data (e.g. invalid dates).

I learnt the importance of trust and camaraderie in the team. Knowing that you can depend on each other during tough times help you to pull through the toughest of days.

There are many more things that I gained through this project that this post would be insufficient to discuss about. However, this project would not be possible without the support of the great teammates I had along the way.
