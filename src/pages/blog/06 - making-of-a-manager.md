title: The Making of a Manager Book Review
date: "2021-11-25"

As the year is coming to an end and the tempo at work has slowed down, I have been spending some time to read another book called the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567">The Making of a Manager</a>. The book illustrates a story of Julie Zhuo, who just became a new manager at the age of 25, navigating through the life as a manager. In the end, Julie understands the most important lesson - great managers are made, not born.

The major takeaways for me, in the order of importance:
- Growth mindset over fixed mindset
- Trust your team members, and develop trust with them
- Build a good and healthy team culture
- Feedback is a gift
- Plan for the future
- Be skilled at delegating tasks
- Have productive meetings (do not waste time by including those who are not necessary in the meetings)

Interestingly, some of the takeaways are similar to another book called the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592">The Phoenix Project</a>. The similarities include building a strong team and planning for the future in order to achieve better outcomes. In the end, achieving excellent outcomes will not be possible without an excellent team.
