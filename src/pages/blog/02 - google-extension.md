In my second last semester in SUTD, I took a course called "User Interface Design and Implementation" (more info <a href="https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/undergraduate/courses/50006-user-interface-design-and-implementation">here</a>). In this course, I worked on a project that aims to improve the user interface of Google Scholar. Through this project, I learnt how to make a Chrome Extension for the first time. 

My team and I managed to publish the app on the Google Chrome Extension store. I am satisfied with this project, as this app is one that I will continue to use in the future.

To download the app, you can find the link <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scholar%2B/jebcfbhiogjccfdaghbngjolfofckgkn?hl=en-US&gl=SG&authuser=2">here</a>
