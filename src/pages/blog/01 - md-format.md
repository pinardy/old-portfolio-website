## Backslash Escapes
Markdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal characters which
would otherwise have special meaning in Markdown’s formatting syntax.

*italics*
\*not italics\* 
(This has a backslash in front of the asterisks, but you won't be able to see it)

## Blockquotes
A wise man once said:
> I am wise
