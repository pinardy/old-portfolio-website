Recently I have been spending some time to read a book called the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592">The Phoenix Project</a>. It's a novel on the topic of IT and DevOps, and how the main character Bill Palmer has 90 days to rescue a company from disaster, otherwise the company would run into huge trouble and the whole IT department would be outsourced.

The major takeaways for me are:
- Do not depend too much on a single person <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">(bus factor)</a>
- Plan for the worst <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">(Murphy's Law)</a>
- Trust your team members
- Improve your processes
- Plan for the future
