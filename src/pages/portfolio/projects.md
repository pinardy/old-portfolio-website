Through the interfacing of the Raspberry Pi 3 with sensors and devices, the Smart Room aims to automate tasks such as turning on/off the lights and aircon. The Smart Room accounts for users who forget to switch off the lights and aircon. Algorithms are designed carefully to provide a smooth and undisruptive experience to the users.

The world has been corrupted with shadows. It is up to you (and your team) to protect the heart of the world from creeping shadows. Luminous was created using the LibGDX library on Android, using NodeJS as the server. 

This project allowed me to practice good software programmming practices such as Git version control, Object-Oriented arrangement of game objects, testing, and more.

During class, teachers have experienced occasions where there is no class participation. A possibility for this silence is students being shy or not confident enough to ask questions during lessons. 

Classy aims to encourage communication between teacher and student, hence enhancing the overall teaching and learning experience. 

Classy was created on Android Studio.

<a href="https://github.com/pinardy/sentiment-analysis">Source code</a>

The aim of this sentiment analysis project is to design a sequence labelling model for informal texts using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The sequence labelling system for informal texts can serve as the very first step towards building a more complex, intelligent sentiment analysis system for social media text.

The Hidden Markov Model was designed from scratch using the Python programming language, with the aid of numpy and pandas.
